Code Quiz 
Implemented buttons for which to assign start and next buttons.
Assigned those buttons to the assigned functions.
Added javascriopt for a countdown timer.
Amended timer to countdown with less time for a wrong answer.
I couldn't affect the timer and keep it consistently on-screen so I used a link technique to give less time upon incorrectly answering.
Added start screen that link to first countdown page.
Linked to second countdown page if incorrect
